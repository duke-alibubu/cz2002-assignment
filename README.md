# OOP and Design Pattern Note:

## SOLID
- Single Responsibility: Each class having a single role --> no more than 1 reason for it to change.
- Open - Closed: A module should be closed for modification but open for extension --> should be able to change what the module do, without changing the source code of the modules
- Liskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. --> Sub should expect no more and provide no less.
- Interface Segregation: Many specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface --> Classes should not depend on interfaces they do not use.
- Dependency Injection: High level modules should not depend upon low level modules --> The dependency should be via abstraction.
<The core of framework design !!!>
